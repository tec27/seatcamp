<p class="secondary">Animated chat for animated people</p>

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>seat.camp is a place for people to come together and talk about almost anything. Using the
power of two second webcam recordings, it can bring about a much deeper sense of connection than
most other Internet communication mediums. Say hi, stay a while!</P>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Show your face! <span class="secondary">You'll get along much better here if you do.
  </span></li>
  <li>Be kind. <span class="secondary">This is a great space, full of welcoming, interesting
  people, many of whom have been here a long time. We're interested in fostering a community that
  people want to come back to often. We hope you are, too!</span></li>
  <li>Participate! <span class="secondary">This experience is better for everyone when you
  don't just sit back and watch from the sidelines. Get in there and make some GIFs!</span></li>
</ul>
